#### What is BMI & WHR?

**Body Mass Index (BMI)** is essentially a value obtained from the weight and height of a person.

**Waist–hip ratio or waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)** is the ratio of the circumference of the waist to that of the hips.

#### Your waist-to-hip (WHR) ratio is: 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
- For men, a ratio of .90 or less is considered safe.
- For women, a ratio of .80 or less is considered safe.
- For both men and women, a WHR of 1.0 or higher is considered “at risk” for heart disease and other problems associated with being overweight.
- WHR should be used as a guideline. Always consult your physician for more information regarding your health risks, Body Mass Index (BMI), and the healthy body weight that is right for you

#### Calculating the BMI
BMI can be computed by dividing the person's weight (kg) by their squared height (m) as follows:

> BMI = kg/m^2

where *kg* represents the person's weight and *m^2* the person's squared height.

#### Calculating the WHR
 This is calculated as waist measurement divided by hip measurement (W ÷ H).
 
 > WHR = (W ÷ H) [both W & H in same unit]

#### About this BMI & WHR Calculator

This ***BMI & WHR Calculator*** is for adults 20 years and older. Further information on calculating BMI for children and teenagers is available from the CDC.
Please note: WHR is not intended for children and those individuals who are less than five feet in height or who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
